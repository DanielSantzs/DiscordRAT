# Discord-Controlled RAT

## Description

This project is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) developed in Python that allows remote control of a system through commands sent via Discord. It provides a practical and efficient way to manage and gather information from the target computer directly through Discord.

## Features

- **Remote Management**: Execute commands and manage the infected system remotely.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Use Discord's chat interface for real-time control and monitoring.
- **Custom Commands**: Tailor commands to perform various actions on the target machine.

## Commands

Available commands are:

- `!window` - Get the currently active window on the infected computer.
- `!admincheck` - Check if the program has administrative privileges.
- `!sysinfo` - Provides detailed information about the infected computer.
- `!wallpaper` - Change the wallpaper on the infected computer.
- `!geolocate` - Geolocate the computer using the IP address.
- `!screenshot` - Capture a screenshot of the user's current screen.
- `!token` - Retrieve the Discord token.
- `!exit` - Exit the program and terminate the session.

## Usage

To use the RAT, run the main script and send the commands in a Discord channel where the bot is active. Ensure that the bot has the necessary permissions to read and send messages in the channel.
